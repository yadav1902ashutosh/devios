    <h1>How to Display HTML Code as Text in a Webpage</h1>
    <p>
        When writing a blog or documentation about web development, you might want 
        to display HTML code as plain text rather than letting the browser interpret it
        as actual HTML. In this article, we'll explore different ways to achieve this.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Does HTML Render Instead of Displaying as Text?</h2>
    <p>
        Browsers are designed to interpret HTML tags and render them accordingly. For 
        example, writing:
        <pre>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        </pre>
        Will result in the browser displaying:

        This is a paragraph.

        Instead of the actual HTML code.
        To prevent this, we need to explicitly tell the browser to treat HTML as plain text.

    <h2>Methods to Display HTML Code as Text</h2>
    <h3>1. Using HTML Entities</h3>
    <p>
        One simple way to display HTML code is by replacing special characters with their 
        HTML entity equivalents:
        <ul>
            <li><pre>< becomes &lt;</pre></li>
            <li><pre>> becomes &gt;</pre></li>
            <li><pre>& becomes &amp;</pre></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
